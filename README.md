## E-Learning Application for Deaf and Mute people
This Application wsas made with Mute and Deaf people in mind, as well as the people wishing to better communicate with them.
It first teaches people how to communucate with ASL Language, and Understand Deaf people's life better.
Then, it's mainly an E-learning platform teaching deaf and mute people any skills that will land them jobs, and the teaching materiel would be adapted to them especially.
Options for Quizzes and projects would be added soon. The app would then be linked to a firebase server. Those are coming soon.
